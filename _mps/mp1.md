### Bare Bone Ray Tracing Due: September 18, 11:55pm

For your first programming assignment you will implement a bare bones ray-tracer with the following capabilities:

1. Ray-object intersection support for:
   1. Planes
   2. Spheres
   3. Triangles
 
2. Orthographic projection
 
3. Perspective projection with a movable camera
 
4. Multi-jittered sampling for the primary rays
 
5. Simple shading using the Blinn-Phong or Phong reflectance model. Just do diffuse (Lambertain) shading without any specular component. Use a directional light with no position

### Hand-in

You will hand in your code and 5 images:

+ One orthographic rendering of a scene with spheres and triangles

+ One perspective rendering of the same scene

+ An additional perspective rendering of the same scene from a different viewpoint

+ Two images illustrating the effects of using jittering. The first image should use a single ray for each pixel, while the second should use multi-jittering. Try to set up a scene so that the difference is apparent. 

Hand-in will be done on Compass and detailed instructions will be forthcoming 

### Technical Details

+ You can use any programming /platform you wish

+ You can use any math library/package you wish to support the vector/matrix operations you need to perform

+ If you wish to use the framework code from Ray-Tracing from the Ground Up, you may.

**Keep in mind that if you use code from other sources, you must document the use of that code**
