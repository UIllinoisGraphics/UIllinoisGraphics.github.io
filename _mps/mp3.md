### <span style="color:blue"> Whitted Ray Tracing and Beyond </span>
**Due: November 8, 11:55pm**

For your third programming assignment you will implement:

1. Support for area lights.  
See _Ray Tracing from the Ground Up **Chapter 18 Area Lights**_

2. Rendering a mirror-like object (implementing perfect specular reflection).  
See _Ray Tracing from the Ground Up **Chapter 24 Mirror Reflection**_
 
3. Rendering a transparent object.  
See _Ray Tracing from the Ground Up **Chapter 27 Simple Transparency**_
         
### Hand-in

**You will hand in your code and 3 images:**

+ One rendering of a scene with an area light that shows soft shadows.
+ One rendering of a transparent object like a glass sphere....include enough of a scene to show it is transparent.
+ One rendering of a mirror-like object...include enough of a scene to show that it is reflective.

**You also need to write a very brief technical report**

Write a paragraph that:
+ provides the technical specifications of the hardware you ran on
+ states which language(s) your implementaion is written in
+ provides a table that shows the **time** and **number of rays** required to render each of your 3 images

**Include a README.txt file in which you list all pieces of code you did not write.**  
This includes any libraries, source code downloaded, or source code you typed in or adapted from a listing you read.  
Please use something like the following format _1. Name-Of-Piece-Of-Code URL-to-Source_ 

Hand-in will be done on Compass.
