### <span style="color:blue"> The Final Scene  </span>
**Due: December 12, 11:55pm**

![Scene](/assets/img/scene.jpg){:height="200px" width="400px"}

For your final programming assignment you will create a scene with the following components:

1. **An object with a noise-based texture.<br/>** See _Ray Tracing from the Ground Up_ Chapter 31 

2. **An object with a procedural volumetric texture.<br/>** See _Ray Tracing from the Ground Up_ Chapter 30.  
 
3. **An object modeled using Constructive Solid Geometry(CSG).**<br/> 
  See [CSG entry on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry). 
         
### Hand-in

**Hand in your code and one or more images demonstrating the above features.**

**You also need to write a brief technical report**

Write a report that:
+ provides the technical specifications of the hardware you ran on
+ states which language(s) your implementaion is written in
+ provides a table that shows the **time** and **number of rays** required to render each of your images.
+ For each extra credit feature you implment (see below), include at least paragraph describing the feature and any interesting things you learned while implementing it or how you made the creative decisions you did in structuring the scene.
**Include a README.txt file in which you list all pieces of code you did not write.**  
This includes any libraries, source code downloaded, or source code you typed in or adapted from a listing you read. Please use something like the following format _1. Name-Of-Piece-Of-Code URL-to-Source_ 

Hand-in will be done on Compass

## Extra Credit

For extra credit, you can implement one or more of the below features. Some of these are difficult and should be approached realistically if you think you won't have much time. The optimal credit per time selection is probably choice number 3...making something that looks awesome 

**1. Photon Mapping**<br/> This has a fairly high level of difficulty. Your work must demonstrate it's use by rendering a scene with caustics and/or subsurface scattering and/or participating media. See [_High Quality Rendering using Ray Tracing and Photon Mapping_ by Henrik Wann Jensen and Per Christian](https://graphics.pixar.com/library/HQRenderingCourse/paper.pdf)

**2. Animation**<br/> Create a reasonable animation...at least 5 seconds and demonstrating some creativity and a good framerate (at least 24 fps). Submit the movie in a common format or (preferably) upload it to YouTube. Your animation does not have to be the scene from this or any other MP...you can do something totally new. Or you can add movement to an existing scene.

**3. Render something that looks awesome**<br/> Be ambitious with your scene. Up to 5 points are awarded solely on my judgement and I am not going to argue about it :) You could consider adding some cool but simple features like motion blur (see [_Ray-Tracing: The Next Weekend_by Peter Shirley_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CO7PQ8C/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1))...or just create a really cool image based on the existing tools you have.

In each case, **partial credit will be awarded sparingly**. Your implementation must produce pretty good results to get credit.

Hand-in will be done on Compass and **in class**.
The extra-credit feature(s) must be shown and described in class on Dec. 12. If we run out of time before you can present, you'll still get credit if you were ready to present.
