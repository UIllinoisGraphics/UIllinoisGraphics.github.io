**TA Office Hours:**
** TBA**
**Grading:**The course grade for the class is broken down among the following items:

Machine Problem 1 15%
Machine Problem 2 15%
Machine Problem 3 15%
Machine Problem 4 10%
Exam 1 15%
Exam 2 15%
Exam 3 15%

**Machine Problems:**
There will be 4 machine problems during the semester. Assignments will be announced in class and on Piazza.Homework submission will be done electronically through Compass.The required files and acceptable file formats for submission will be specified in the assignment.

**Exams:**
There will be three exams. We will use the [Computer Based Testing Facility](https://edu.cs.illinois.edu/cbtf/).  
**The dates of the exams will be
*   Exam 1 Oct. 2   - Oct. 5
*   Exam 2 Oct. 30 - Nov. 2

**Extra Credit:** At 3 lectures during the semester, I will take attendance. If you attended that lecture, you will receive 0.5% of the total course grade as extra credit. This means there is a total of 1.5% of the grade available as extra credit, which could easily be the difference between letter grades. This will be the only extra credit opportunity offered during the course.


**Late**  **Homework**  **or**  **Projects:**Machine problemssubmitted  after  the  due  datelose 10% per day.In  exceptional  circumstances  where  extension  may  be  reasonable  (illness,  family  emergency  etc.)  arrangement  must  be  made  with  the  instructor.

**Collaboration:**  You  should  collaborate on the MPs. You should not copy code verbatim from each other or the web.

**Software:**   We will use HTML/JavaScript/WebGL and GLSL for the programming assignments. No prior knowledge of these is required for the class.

**Commenting Code:** All files, classes, methods and properties should be documented with JSDoc comments with the appropriate tags and types.  
                                  Details can be found in the [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml?showone=Comments#Comments).
