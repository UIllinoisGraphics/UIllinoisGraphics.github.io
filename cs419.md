CS 419: Production Rendering
Spring  2017
Tu/Th    11:00 – 12:15 am, 
Room 1103 Siebel Center

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 
Department of Computer Science
 Instructor : Eric Shaffer
Office Hour: Thursday 2:30-3:30pm in 2103 Siebel Center

Book:  Ray-Tracing from the Ground Up 

Piazza: This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, we encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. 
Find our class page at:  https://piazza.com/illinois/spring2017/cs419.

Machine Problems: 

There will be 4 MPs
Each is worth 15% of the total course grade
Late Work Policy: 

No late submissions will be accepted for MP1.
Thereafter, the late policy will to accept MP submissions at a penalty of 10% off per day late.
Exceptions to the policy can be made in the case of documented illness or other exceptional circumstances. Contact the instructor via e-mail.
Coding and Collaboration: 

Unless otherwise specified in the assignment you should feel free to collaborate as long as you document it.
You must follow the CS 419 Coding Conventions.
Some example code for the course is available at https://github.com/shaffer1/UIllinois_Rendering
This code is in Python and partially implements some of the assignments. You are free to use this code as long as you document your use.
​Exams: 

There will be two exams.
The tentative exam dates are February 28 and April 24
Each exam is worth 20% of the course grade.
The exams will be multi-choice and consist of 21 questions graded out of 20 questions.
The exams will draw heavily on the assigned reading. 
Grading: MPs are worth 60% of the total grade midterm exam 40%

Software: You are free to use any programming language and computing platform you wish for the programming assignments.

Other Policies: Do not make class material publicly available. The code you write is your own and you may make it public if you wish.
