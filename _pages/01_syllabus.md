**Piazza**
 
This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, we encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. 
Find our class page at:  [https://piazza.com/illinois/fall2018/cs419](https://piazza.com/illinois/fall2018/cs419)

**Machine Problems** 

There will be 4 MPs
Each is worth 15% of the total course grade

**Late Work Policy**

The late policy will to accept MP submissions at a penalty of 10% off per day late.Exceptions to the policy can be made in the case of documented illness or other exceptional circumstances. Contact the instructor via e-mail.

**Coding and Collaboration** 

Unless otherwise specified in the assignment, you should feel free to collaborate on designing a solution to the MPs. You must document your collaborators. Submit the name and netids of all collaborators in a README.txt file along with your code submission. Each person should type in the code on their own, rather than simply sharing files or copying and pasting. Each required image submission should be a unique scene, meaning each collaorator should submit scenes they have created themselves. 

In addition, you must follow the CS 419 Coding Conventions...which consist of supplying a list of all libraries or other code grabbed and/or copied in your project. In the same README.txt file, list each software resource on a separate line using a format of:  

_(Name of Resource)_ _(url or other reference)_

The exams will draw heavily on the assigned reading.
